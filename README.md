==================================
The VNC Roll
==================================

Remote desktop service for Rocks Clusters.


Description
===========
The VNC roll installs and configure a remote desktop service based on TigerVNC and
NoVNC that will enable users to run graphical user interfaces on the cluster
without any local software on the client machine than a modern browser that
JavaScript and HTML5.  Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari and Internet Explorer are
supported by this setup.  It is even possible to use the service on devices
without physical keyboard and mouse like tablets and mobile phones, but the 
X desktops are kind of clunky and not very usable on such devices.
