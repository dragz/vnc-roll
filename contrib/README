This tree mostly contains local adaptations for the Stallo cluster at UiT.

tcpwrapper
-------------

Config for automatic whitelisting based on client ip that have
made a successful ssh login. 

xfce
------------

Config changes to use XFCE instead of GNOME.  XFCE is more lightweight and and a bit
more simplistic than GNOME.  We mainly prefer it because we do not provide full
desktop support for our users, we just want to make it possible to run scientific
software with GUIs like Matlab, VMD etc.
