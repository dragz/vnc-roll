XFCE setup.
------------

Adaptations to use xdm and XFCE instead of gdm/GNOME.  XFCE use far
less resources than GNOME.  Besides, XFCE is much more limited in
functionality so our users are not led to believe that we do desktop
support...


Installation.
---------------

```
mkdir -p /export/rocks/install/extras/vnc/
cp vnc/* /export/rocks/install/extras/vnc/
```

and move extend-vnc.xml into the right place.
